# Edgemap 

This repository contains edgeUI for browser based mapping with [Protomaps](https://protomaps.com/).

EdgeUI is stripped down version of [Edgemap](https://resilience-theatre.com/edgemap/) firmware image for
[Raspberry Pi4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) and does not need tileserver-gl to serve 
mbtiles. All maps are pmtiles handled by [maplibre-gl-js](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) library.
